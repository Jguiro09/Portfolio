                    Hello! My name is Jacob Guiro. I was born and raised in New Jersey until early 2020 when I moved to Houston, Texas. While in New Jersey, I attended and graduated from Woodbridge High School and would actively participate in school activities such as joining the tennis team, or participating in community service. This all changed once COVID put all of us into a lockdown. With the lockdown limitations, all I could do was focus on school and in June 2020 I gradtuated High School and made the move to Houston, TX.<br>
                    <br>
                    I began to get more into film and coding as a hobbies. I even majored in film for one semester at Houston Baptist Univeristy. Attending HBU proved to me that my passion wasn't in creating films, but it was in helping others and making people feel happy. With my natural talent for technology, I decided to focus more on computer science and I am currently attending the Full-Satck Coding Boot Camp at UT Austin. <b>GRADUATING SEPTEMBER 2021</b>.
