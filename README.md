## Deployed Website
[**Click here for portfolio**](https://jguiro09.github.io/Portfolio/)

## Primary Goal
The goal of this project was to be able to make a portfolio website that we would be able to put our projects in. The catch was that the portfolio had to be a responsive website.

## Why A Responsive Website Is Important
A responsive website will adjust its content to be able to fit on all forms of devices. Normally, this would not be a huge deal if everyone looked at websites on their computers, but thats not what the statistics say.

[**According to perficient, "68.1% of all website visits in 2020 came from mobile devices"**](https://www.perficient.com/insights/research-hub/mobile-vs-desktop-usage)

With this in mind, a website should be able to adapt to both a computer monitor's resolution, AND a mobile device's resolution.

## Utilization of Flexbox
One way to make a website responsive is using "flexbox". Flex box allows you to store items inside of a container and allow us to manipulate these items to adjust to the width and height of the display resolution.

## Creation of Website


### NOTES
**The "responsive" changes are not shown completely here. If you would like to see that portion, please access my style.css and scroll to line 183.**

**RED BORDER = A DIV**

**BLUE BORDER = A SECTION**

### Understanding Units Used
The following units were used inside my coding with (sourced from [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_units.asp)):
```
    1. VH =  Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport
    2. VW = Relative to 1% of the width of the viewport
    3. % = Relative to parent element
```

### **Header**
#### Wireframe
<img src = "./assets/photos/README/HeaderWireframe.png" alt = "Header Wireframe">

#### HTML Applied
<img src = "./assets/photos/README/HeaderHTML.png" alt = "Header HTML">

#### CSS Applied
